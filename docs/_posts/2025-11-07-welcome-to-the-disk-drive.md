Welp, here we go now. This setup should be enough for me to get started. 

As you can see, I finally got around to making my own website. I called it the Disk Drive since the [Famicom Disk System](https://famiwiki.net/wiki/Family_Computer_Disk_System) is my primary research & development interest as of the creation of this site, and thus the posts here could be considered as disk files. The purpose of this website is to:

- Act as a portfolio for my GitHub repositories and other projects. 
- Host long-form stories & information regarding said projects, since linking from here is easier when posting on places such as Mastodon and Discord.
- Host information for certain topics while I ~~procrastinate~~ contribute to places such as the [NESdev Wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki) and [FamiWiki](https://famiwiki.net/wiki/Main_Page).

I've yet to come to full grips with Jekyll and such, so please don't be surprised if the pages break suddenly.
