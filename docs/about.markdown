TakuikaNinja, Local Kiwi Nerd. Probably spends too much time on research & development hobbies pertaining to 8-bit Nintendo consoles, especially the Famicom Disk System. Barely has the time to play games for said hardware because of it. 

Okay, this third-person perspective is hard to write in. I blame the Wii U Famicom Remix games, along with GameCenter CX videos on Nintendo eShop, for making me end up with this hobby. The Wii U is also responsible for my love of the Splatoon series. 

## Notable Works

### Research & Development

See my [repositories](https://github.com/TakuikaNinja?tab=repositories) for:

- FDS test programs: It's (current year) and FDS emulation is still not good enough.
- FDS BIOS Dumper program, because apparently no one else thought of dumping it to disk.
- Several Proof-of-Concept ports of cartridge games to disk format, mostly to replicate bootleg disk ports.
- Archived & recreated Disk BASIC from hacking magazines.
- Documented an IPL interface present in Namco FDS games:
   - IPL.MAIN disassembly
   - IPL-demo example program
   - Mesen2 Lua script
   - Arduino interface recreation

Blog posts about some of these projects are coming soon. 

Other projects:

- Forgotten in Time (NESmaker demo)
- Misc. game hacks, mostly to fix DPCM bit-reversal and other bugs.
- Misc. original games.
